### 4. Problems Covered This Week

- [Best time to buy and sell stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)(Easy)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    
    # Brute Force Approach

        max_profit = 0
        n = len(prices)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if profit > max_profit:
                    max_profit = profit
        return max_profit

    # Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of days (two nested loops).
    # Space Complexity: O(1), as we're only using a fixed amount of extra space.

    # Two Pointer Approach

        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price  # Update min_price if current price is lower
            elif price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price  # Update max_profit if current profit is higher
        return max_profit

    # Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of days. We only need to traverse the list once.
    # Space Complexity: O(1), as we're only using a fixed amount of extra space.
```

- [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)(Medium)

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
    
        # Two Pointer Approach
        red, white, blue = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while white <= blue:
            if nums[white] == 0:
                if nums[red] != 0:
                    nums[red], nums[white] = nums[white], nums[red]
                
                white += 1
                red += 1

            elif nums[white] == 1:
                white += 1

            else:
                if nums[blue] != 2:
                    nums[white], nums[blue] = nums[blue], nums[white]

                blue -= 1

        return nums

        # Time complexity: O(n), since weâ€™re only traversing the array once.
        # Space complexity: O(1), since no extra space is used.
```

- [Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)(Hard)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the result list
        res = []

        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            # Find the maximum value in the current window and append to res
            max_val = max(nums[i:i+k])
            res.append(max_val)

        return res

        # Time Complexity: O(n*k), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the window size.
        # Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, accounting for the space needed to store the result for each window.
```
